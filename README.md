## Objective
Develop a web application that allows users to play a video game similar to _Starglider_, providing a personalized experience for each user. The goal is for each game to be played by a registered player, with the player aiming to surpass their own record in each session.

### Specific Objectives
- Develop a scoring system that links a user to their highest score obtained through the use of files and PHP.
- Create a video game with a 3D environment using the JavaScript programming language.
- Generate various visual effects in the game using CSS and the different tools that allow us to manipulate JavaScript, such as time and the DOM (Document Object Model).
- Include audio effects in the video game with the help of JavaScript.
- Implement a login system using PHP so that all users who play are registered and their scores are automatically saved.


## Technologies
The project was developed as a web application that utilized various languages such as **HTML** (_Hypertext Markup Language_), **CSS** (_Cascading Style Sheets_), **PHP** (_Personal Home Page_), and **JavaScript**, as each of these languages addresses different aspects of the application. CSS, for example, was used to style the graphical interfaces and special effects in the game, PHP was used to manage user information on the server side, while JavaScript was primarily used for the game itself, aided by the _THREE.js_ library, which facilitated the creation of graphics.
